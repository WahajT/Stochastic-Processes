Abstract
We consider transformations of random variables and derive
the c.d.f. and density functions of the transformed random vari-
ables. A leading example is the probability integral transform,
which transforms a random variable into a uniform random vari-
able.A random variable is a numerical description of the out-
come of a statistical experiment. It can be discrete or contin-
uous depending upon the outcome of experiment.Often we are
required to generate new distribution or density function with
closed forms from a given distribution. Programmatically, it
might be easy, but sometimes looking beyond just numbers is
required to obtain specific parameters for new distributions such
as mean, standard deviation, moment generating functions, etc.
Hence, knowing the methodology of generating new distribution
by the transformation of a random variable is significant. In this
article, we will look at the transformation of a random variable
to create a new distribution from a continuous distribution given
the transformation function.
